# rust_battle_simulator
### :construction: under construction ... :construction:
I'm currently learning rust by reading the amazing book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).
This project was just a short break to practice some concepts I've learned so far (until chapter 6).

It's a very simple game in cli that simulates a battle between a wizard and a warrior, you can pick up your character and attack or defend.
